# RetroPie Gaming Kit — Getting Started

Your Raspberry Pi retro console is ready for action (no ROMs included).

## What's in the box
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) with case + fan
- 64GB microSD (pre‑flashed RetroPie)
- Official USB‑C 5V/3A power supply
- 2× Wireless controllers (pairing mode enabled)
- Micro‑HDMI → HDMI cable

## First boot
1. Insert the microSD, connect HDMI and power.
2. RetroPie will expand its filesystem on first boot (takes 1–2 minutes).

## Controller pairing
1. Power on the controller(s) holding **Start** for pairing.
2. In EmulationStation, press a button to start **Controller Configuration**.
3. Map D‑pad, A/B, Start/Select, and Hotkey (usually **Select**).

## Adding your own ROMs
- Over network: use `\\retropie\roms\` (Windows) or `smb://retropie/roms/` (macOS).
- Or copy via USB: add files to `/roms/<system>/`.
- Only use ROMs you legally own.

## Useful tips
- **Hotkey + Start**: Exit game.
- **Hotkey + X**: RetroArch menu.
- **Audio**: EmulationStation → Start → Sound Settings.

## Troubleshooting
- No display? Verify you're using **micro‑HDMI** port and the cable is fully seated.
- Controller not pairing? Plug it in via USB first, then unplug to finalize pairing.
